## Methods in Design Implementation Support Phase

#### [User Stories](../2-Define/Methods/user-stories.md)

User stories can document all the features the app needs to support. The design team can use user stories to communicate with developers. 

#### [Use Case](../2-Define/Methods/use-cases.md)

Similar to user stories, use cases can also be used as documentation of design features to facilitate communication between designers and developers. 

#### [Style Guide](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/style-guide.md)

A style guide should specify all styling related rules and details of the design, such as colors, fonts, spacing and positioning.
