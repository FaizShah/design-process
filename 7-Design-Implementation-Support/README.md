# Design Implementation Support: Documentation of the design
The Design Implementation Support phase encompasses all efforts towards supporting development once the design prototype is approved by the client. This might entail continued oversight on development and ensuring that the development is as per specifications. In addition to availability to support and answer any questions or concerns faced during development, any documentation required to turn over development responsibilities to internal teams shall be created in this phase.

## Methods in Design Implementation Support Phase

#### [User Stories](../2-Define/Methods/user-stories.md)

User stories can document all the features the app needs to support. The design team can use user stories to communicate with developers. 

#### [Use Case](../2-Define/Methods/use-cases.md)

Similar to user stories, use cases can also be used as documentation of design features to facilitate communication between designers and developers. 

#### [Style Guide](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/style-guide.md)

A style guide should specify all styling related rules and details of the design, such as colors, fonts, spacing and positioning. 

#### [Functional Specs](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/functional-specs.md)

Functional specs document describes the functionality and expected behaviors of all elements in the design.
