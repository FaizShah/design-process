## Design Specifications Document

#### What is it?
It is a written document that specifies styling rules and details of the design, including:
* Colors
* Typography
* Icons
* Layout
* Spacing

#### Why do you do it?
To give the developers enough input to build the UI exactly the same as the design. 

#### When to do it?
After the final design is approved by clients. 

#### How to do it?
The design team has multiple options on how to produce the style guide depending on the given time and budget. 
* If time allows, the team can create this document from scratch so that it can include all necessary descriptions and explanations.
  * It should include global rules that apply everywhere in the design, such as rules for colors or fonts
  * Then walk through each object to specify unique details
* The team can also utilize the Inspect mode on InVision to document styling details, which is faster and more convinient. The design team needs to make sure that this is an acceptable deliverable since it's online and doesn't include any description. 
* There are also Sketch plugins that can help with design specs, such as Sketch Measure which export specs into html files. The design team needs to make sure all the layers are grouped and named properly so that the files are easy to read.
