## Functional Specifications Document

#### What is it?
It's a very comprehensive document that specifies the expected functionality, interactions, and business rulesin the design. It can include user stories or use cases.

#### Why do you use it?
The purpose of this document is to:
* Tell the stakeholders what they are getting and get them to approve
* Tell the developers what functions to build
* Tell the testers what functions to test

#### When to use it?
It is typically written at the end of the design engagement - in the Design Implementation Support phase. This document is intended to include details therefore it is time comsuming. Therefore it's only done when time and budget allows.

#### How to do it?

1. The functional specs document should follow the hierarchy of the design. First, sort out what components there are, for example: No.1 Header component.
2. Then specify the different objects within the component. For example, within the Header component, there are Page Navigation Buttons, Search Bar, Notification Button, etc.
3. Describe each object, including:
   * The purpose of this object (could be in the format of a user story)
   * Different states of the object
   * Attributes of the object (or items within the object)
   * How the user can interact with it, such as hover or click on it
   * What happens when the user interacts with it
   * Data elements involved in it (entity names should match data dictionary)
   * Business rules associated with it
