## Design Hand Off

#### What is it?
After the final design gets approved, the design team needs to hand it off to the development team. It should include 
* Meetings where a designer walks through the design prototype with the developer, and explain what documents are provided and how to use them
* Documents that support development, such as user stories/use cases, design specifications document, and functional specifications document

#### Why do you do it?
Because the developers need to understand the design thoroughly in order to build it accurately. The hi-fi mockups we produce are static images, and prototypes on InVision are semi-interactive and do not cover all the details in the design. Therefore, the design team needs this step to make sure the developers are on the same page.

#### When to do it?
At the end of the design engagement, after the final design is approved by client.

#### How to do it?

1. Schedule a meeting with the developer(s)
2. Walk through the final design (InVision prototype or Hi-fi mockups) - this walkthrough should focus on the function specs
   * Explain the structure of the app
    * Pages > Components > Objects
    * How to navigate through
   * Walk through each object - doesn't need to elaborate for standard QlikView or Qlik Sense objects
     * The purpose of the object
     * Different states of the object
     * Interactions
     * Data elements
     * Business rules
 3. Briefly walk through any supporting documents
 4. Send final design and documents to the development team
 5. Answer questions when needed
