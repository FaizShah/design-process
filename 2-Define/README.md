# Define: Synthesizing the research into usable models

The second phase of the design sprint is all about synthesizing research and information 
collected in the Understand phase into usable models. Usable models could be of various 
types like Personna Cards, Scenarios, and Task Analyses.

Throughout the Define phase, you should be working on creating usable models
based out on the research and understansing of the problem statement.
The team should be vigilant of the business process of the client, and should be able to 
model the process, as well as identify where the solution at work fits in the process.
The team should be able to synthesize the outcomes of interviews with clients and consolidate
them into creating multiple personas which reqresent various client segments.  

The team should also advance the understanding of the job at hand into defining scenarios
that would cement use cases of the solution.At the end of Define phase, the team should 
have developed concrete user scenarios, personas, and strong task analyses.

## A Guide for Define:

As you work through the Define phase of an engagement there will be a lot of
discussion regarding scenarios and personas that encompass the entire domain of the 
client use cases.

Explore scenarios and embrace an open mind to appreciate all aspects of client tasks that
shall be touched by the outcome of the design sprint.

###### Inputs/Prerequisites:

* Notes from Interviews: 
The team should revisit knowledge from client interviews so as to build robust definitions
of client scenarios and strong personas.
 
* Assumptions and Key Take-aways:
The team should be mindful of assumptions and key take-aways from client interviews. This
shall provide ability to better develop user scenarios and personas that address
a wide range of possibilities and use cases. 

###### Outputs/Artifacts:

* Personas
The team should develop personas, based on the problem definition and client interviews.
Multiple personas should be created so that various client and user traits can be addressed
during designing the solution. Personas clearly outline user traits and help develop 
user scenarios. 

* User Scenarios
The team should hash out scenarios in which the solution that the engagement aims to achieve 
shall interact with the users. Determining user scenarios would better help the team to design
a truly usable and viable solution to the problem at hand.  

* Task Analyses
The team should perform detailed task analysis to clearly determine aspects of 
the business process that the design engagement aims to address.

## Methods/Techniques in the Define phase:

#### [Personas](../2-Define/Exercises/personas.md)

Creating personas help categorize and segment various aspects of the problem and their 
desired solution. They aid in providing personal caracteristics and attributes to 
multiple viewpoints of the problem that the team as well as clients could easily relate to. 
Creating personas should be a comprehensive task that takes all outcomes of interviews
with the client and assumptions, bundled into a relatable use case.

#### [Empathy Map](../2-Define/Exercises/empathy-map.md)
An empathy map is a collaborative tool teams can use to gain a deeper insight into their customers. Much like a user persona, an empathy map can represent a group of users, such as a customer segment. The empathy map was originally created by Dave Gray and has been gaining popularity with the agile community.

#### [Organization Chart](../2-Define/Exercises/org-chart.md)
An organization chart helps the designer clarify the relationship between different personas/roles within the client's organization, and provide a baseline for prioritizing needs or grouping information. It is especially helpful when many personas or multiple business functions are involved in the Understand phase.

#### [Card Sorting](../2-Define/Exercises/card-sorting.md)

Card sorting with the client helps categorize and prioritize features, ideas and different concepts so that it is easier to understand the problem. 
It is useful for working through user flow, moving features to the back burner board and merging similar ideas.

#### [Problem Statement](../2-Define/Exercises/problem-statement.md)
Identifying the problem will help to determine if there is a problem, if that problem is solvable, and how to solve that problem. This step will be the first step to answering this question: What is this solution, and is it useful?

#### [User Scenarios](../2-Define/Exercises/user-scenarios.md)
Creating user scenarios help narrow down the efforts of the team to understand aspects of 
the problem that affect clients business process. These scenarios channel efforts of the 
design engagement towards solving problems that affect daily tasks of clients.

#### [Task Analysis](../2-Define/Exercises/task-analysis.md)
Task analysis is the process of learning how the users perform their tasks and achieve the intended goals. It helps the designer decide the tasks the solution needs to support and define the navigation and workflow. 

#### [Business Process Mapping](../2-Define/Exercises/business-process.md)
The team should make efforts to model the business process that serves as the basis of the 
problem at hand. This shall help determine any missing aspects or loopholes in the understanding 
and could also help realize potential risks.
