## Task Analysis

#### What is it?
Task analysis is a process of learning and analyzing the tasks and subtasks a persona needs to perform to achieve business goals. It outlines the hierarchy and sequence of the tasks. 

#### Why do you do it?
Task analysis can help the designers understand:
* What your user is trying to achieve
* What tasks the user needs to perform to achieve those goals
* The relationship between the tasks
* How these tasks are performed

#### When to do it?
In the define phase, after establishing personas.

#### How to do it?
1. Start by identifying the persona's business goal, such as "Increase sales".
2. List out the highest level tasks the persona needs to perform to achieve the goal, such as "Monitor current year sales performance".
3. Breakdown the high level tasks into subtasks, like "Compare sales amount of current year sales to prior year".
4. Keep breaking down tasks into lower levels.
5. Draw a layered diagram with all the tasks (subtasks).
