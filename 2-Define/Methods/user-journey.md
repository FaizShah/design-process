User journey mapping is a way to deconstruct a userâ€™s experience with a product or service as a series of steps and themes. Along the steps, it also highlights user's thoughts, feelings/emothions, and goals. 

Example:

![User Journey 1](/images/user-journey-1.jpg)

Alternatively, a user journey map can also be constructed like a big table:

![User Journey 3](/images/user-journey-3.png)
