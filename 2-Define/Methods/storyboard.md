## Storyboard

#### What is it?
Storyboards are illustrations that represent shots that ultimately represent a story. Basically, it’s a sequential art, where images are arrayed together to visualise the story. 

#### Why do you use it?
Storyboarding in UX is tool which help you visually predict and explore a user’s experience with a product. It would help you to understand how people would flow through the interaction with it over time, giving you a clear sense of how to create a strong narrative.

#### When to do it?
Use this method after the user interviews or while thinking of concepts

#### How to do it?
Think about your product as if it was a movie in terms of how people would use it. You don't need to be an artist to create a storyboard. Focus on the story rather than the quality of your drawings. Rough sketches and stick figures are prefectly acceptable.

Think about the character for your storyboard - Who is the persona? What are their goals, motivations etc?(persona cards can help feed this)
Decide on the plot - The storyboard starts with a trigger and shows subsequent steps of how the narrative unfolds. 
Visualize the scene or the world in which the character lives

* Start with plain text and arrows that breaks the story up. 
* Add emotions to the text.
* Translate the text into storyboard frames.
