## Use Case

#### What is it?
A use case describes a list of actions or event steps that a user takes to achieve a goal or accomplish a task. It is also used to document requirements, in a much more elaborated manner compared to user stories. 

#### Why do you use it?
Use cases inform how your solution should behave and identify gaps.  

#### When to use it?
This method is used after the understand phase and ideally after personas have been identified.

#### How to do it?
Depending on how in depth and complex you want or need to get, use cases describe a combination of the following elements:
* Primary Actor – stakeholder who initiates an interaction with the system to achieve a goal
* Actor – anyone or anything that performs a behavior (who is using the system)
* Stakeholder – someone or something with vested interests in the behavior of the system under discussion (SUD)
* Preconditions – what must be true or happen before and after the use case runs.
* Triggers – this is the event that causes the use case to be initiated.
* Main success scenarios [Basic Flow] – use case in which nothing goes wrong.
* Alternative paths [Alternative Flow] – these paths are a variation on the main theme. These exceptions are what happen when things go wrong at the system level.

Identify who the actor is - this is the user
Identify the task or goal that the user is trying to accomplish
List down the sequence of steps that will enable the user to accomplish his task or goal.
