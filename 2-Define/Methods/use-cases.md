A use case describes a list of actions or event steps that a user takes to achieve a goal or accomplish a task. It is also used to document requirements, in a much more elaborated manner compared to user stories. Depending on how in depth and complex you want or need to get, use cases describe a combination of the following elements:

* Primary Actor – stakeholder who initiates an interaction with the system to achieve a goal
* Actor – anyone or anything that performs a behavior (who is using the system)
* Stakeholder – someone or something with vested interests in the behavior of the system under discussion (SUD)
* Preconditions – what must be true or happen before and after the use case runs.
* Triggers – this is the event that causes the use case to be initiated.
* Main success scenarios [Basic Flow] – use case in which nothing goes wrong.
* Alternative paths [Alternative Flow] – these paths are a variation on the main theme. These exceptions are what happen when things go wrong at the system level.

Example:

##### Use case: Review Records   

##### Actor: Doctor

##### Steps:
* Doctor walks into room
* Doctor sees patient in bed
* Doctor identifies patient in bed
* Doctor sees medical charts on foot of bed
* Doctor gets medical charts from foot of bed
* Doctor opens medical charts
* Doctor reads medical charts
* Doctor changes pages to continue reading
* Doctor closes medical chart
