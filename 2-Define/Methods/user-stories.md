User stories are concise, easy to understand and are a great way to captures requirements. They can break down a project into smaller milestones that the team can work towards achieving.

#### When to use it?
This method is used early on in the process after the understand phase. 

#### How to do it?
While the format varies on organizational/personal preferences, the traditional format for creating user stories uses the following statement:

##### As a (User Role), I (want/need) (goal/desire) so that (benefit).

#### Example:

As a doctor, I need to get up to medical date records so that I know how to proceed with my patients’ treatment
