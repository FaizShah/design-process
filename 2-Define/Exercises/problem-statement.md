A problem statement could be constructed with the following aspects:

  * Who is impacted?
  * What are the negative impacts?
  * Where does it happen?
  * When/how often does it happen?
  * Why is it important? (optional - as it could be part of the 5 why's)

The problem statement should be short and simple, and focus on only one problem. It doesn't need to suggest any solutions. The statement can then be analyzed using the 5 Why's.

Example:
The problem of customers constantly smoking in our rooms affects other customers, who donâ€™t appreciate the smoke and smell, and our housekeeping staff, who spend significantly more time cleaning smoking rooms versus nonsmoking ones, the impact of which is low customer satisfaction, reduced occupancy rates, and increased cleaning costs.
