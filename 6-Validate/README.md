# Validate: Test the right path

Reactions to competitive demos, our assumptions for the prototype, what we were
looking for and the reactions to the prototype.
Going into each validation test you should have a plan of what you are validating and how you
know if that is successful or not. This is best achieved through a [Assumption /
Validation table](../Exercises/assumptions-validations.md)

## Methods in Validate Phase

#### Stakeholder/User Review

Reviewing the design with stakeholders and users is the core activity in the validation phase. It allows the design team to observe users' reactions to the design and to collect their feedback, so that they can better refine the design.


#### Technical Review

The designer needs to walk the developer throught the design, and make sure everything is possible to build and raise red flags if anything takes extra effort. This step is especially important if an estimate of build document is one of the final deliverables.


#### Refine Design

The design team will take the feedback from the stakeholder/user review and implement changes to the prototype, and then circle back to the stakeholders and users to get further feedback or approval.


#### Future Recommendations

Sometimes the desgin team can't address all the needs of the users because either time constraint or technology limitations. In such situations, it is helpful to document these unfulfilled needs as recommendations for future engagements.

#### Usability Testing

This is the most used form of testing. Bring in 4â€“6 potential users and show
them the prototype that you made. Pay close attention to problems that they have
and be sure to follow a script to cover the assumptions that you are testing.
With their permission you can record these but it's best to see them as they happen.


#### Survey Test

This is a good way to reach a bunch of potential users and see their answers.
Create a simple form with [Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/about/)
or [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/).
Post the form to forums or other places that would have ideal users on it.
Make sure the form is easy to fill out
and open ended enough to collect qualitative information.

#### Fake landing page

To judge interest create a fake landing page with email collection.
This could be something as simple
as a [Launchrock](http://launchrock.co/) page
or a [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/) site or a
completely custom site with a [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/) form
for email collection. Run Google Analytics and see how many people sign up and
how many people visit.
