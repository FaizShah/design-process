# Prototype

During this phase, the designers will build high fidelity mockups and assemble prototype for the validation phase. For the hi-fi mockups, the designers need to iron out the layout, styles and interactions. Even though fake data is used in the mockups, the designer should still insert some realistic data for better storytelling.

### Tasks/Activities for Prototype

#### [Wireframe](/5-Prototype/Methods/wireframe.md)

Building a wireframe before producing the high fidelity mockups could be very beneficial. A wireframe allows the team to quickly explore different layouts and establish the workflow without worrying about the styling details. 


#### Mockup with Sketch

Sketch is the primary tool the team uses to create high fidelity mockups. Here are some useful resources for the team: [Axis Design Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwLVd0W-_5qwZEZnMzRETEZ5QjA)


#### Prototype with InVision

Invision really great for being able to take mockups from Photoshop or Sketch and
allow for users to click through different states or pages. 

Example of a prototype on InVision: [Prototype: Conflicts in Democratic Republic of Congo](https://invis.io/3VBJDMIGC)


#### QlikSense

When mocking up a QlikSense app, it is sometimes easier build sheets directly in QlikSense, especially when there's sample data provided. The team can also explore extension objects on [Qlik Branch](http://branch.qlik.com)

#### Tumult Hype

A good alternative to raw HTML & CSS is to use [Hype](http://tumult.com/hype/) with which you can quickly record and generate interactive animations to show how users will interact with dashboards. Here's a quick [overview of prototyping using Hype for prototyping](https://blog.prototypr.io/the-leader-in-digital-prototyping-6d392e0df7a). The [Design Sales and Marketing website](http://richsimon.x10host.com/DE_v19.html) was built with Hype.

#### HTML & CSS

HTML & CSS prototypes tend to be the most time consuming but are best for
heavier web interactions like filling out forms.

#### [Paper Prototype](http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping)

Paper prototyping is as low-fi as you can get for a prototype. It is especially useful when you are under a time crunch to produce a prototype. It also allows for the whole team to contribute. Because the prototype is sketches on paper you are relying much more on the imagination of the participant. It gives you the ability to prototype on the fly, even during the session with the participant.
