# Prototype: Quickly build the right path

The core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions you are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps you are trying to fill should have all
been discussed in [Converge](../3-Converge). During this phase you will build a
quick and dirty prototype. Since you only have limited time to build the
prototype it should be as low-fi as you can get away with during [Testing](../5-Test).

During this phase roles shift. Designers are typically the ones building the
prototype unless it is low-fi enough for everyone to contribute
(see: [Paper Prototype](#paper-prototype)).
Solution Directors should be in charge of getting
realistic information, data and copy into the prototype.
It should be clear what everyone's role is
before the phase starts.
The team should check in with each other as much as possible
to make sure everything is on the right track.

### Tasks/Activities for Prototype

#### [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/)

Invision really great for being able to take mockups from Photoshop or Sketch and
allow for users to click through to different states or pages. Invision allows
for you to create a simple image map for your users. Because it takes mockups it
allows for you to create designs that look more visually appealing or visually
complete.

#### QlikSense
QlikSense is a great way to create prototypes that could be interactive and workable 
with dummy data to show how data talks to one another.

#### HTML & CSS

HTML & CSS prototypes tend to be the most time consuming but are best for
heavier web interactions like filling out forms.

#### [Paper Prototype](http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping)

Paper prototyping is as low-fi as you can get for a prototype.
It is especially useful when you are
under a time crunch to produce a prototype.
It also allows for the whole team to contribute.
Because the prototype is sketches on paper you are relying
much more on the imagination of the participant.
It gives you the ability to prototype on the fly,
even during the session with the participant.
Tools like [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/apps) 
and [POP](https://popapp.in/) can help
present sketches on a mobile device
or in the browser so that it seems more real.
