## Wireframe

#### What is it?
A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a pageâ€™s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. Wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. 

#### Why do you do it?
It allows the design team to explore different layout options so that they can choose one that optimizes the user flow. Having a established wireframe before building high fidelity mockups can save a lot of time on rearranging and resizing objects. 

#### When to do it?
After concepts and views are decided, before building high fidelity mockups. 

#### How to do it?
1. Lay out all the content that belongs to this view, such as buttons, filters, dropdowns, and charts.
2. Group them logically into components.
3. Lay out different components on the page using boxes. Each box represents one component.
4. Explore different layouts.
5. Review the layout, make adjustments, and decide on one to use for mockups.
