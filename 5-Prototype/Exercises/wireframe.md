A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a pageâ€™s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. Wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish navigation between different pages within the app.

Example:

![Wireframe](/images/wireframe.png?raw=true "Wireframe")
