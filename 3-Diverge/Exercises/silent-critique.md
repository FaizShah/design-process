Give everybody a bunch of dot stickers. Then, without speaking, everybody looks at the different ideas and puts a sticker on every idea or part of an idea they like. There are no limits to how many stickers you can use, and voting for their own ideas is also allowed. By the end, youâ€™ve got a kind of heat map, and some ideas are already standing out.

Example:

![Silent Critiques](/images/silent-critiques.png?raw=true "Silent Critiques")
