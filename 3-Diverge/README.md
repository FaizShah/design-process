## Diverge: Illuminating all possible paths

Our goal is to explore as many ideas as possible, regardless of how feasible they may or may not be. Diverging helps gain insights that comes from radically different perspectives and approaches to solving a problem. These insights
can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solutions. Also, once we begin eliminating some these options in the next phase, we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

* Have a mindset of "Yes" and constantly ask “How might we?”

## Input/Output

###### Inputs/Prerequisites:

* Personas and Key Questions: 
The team should familiarize themselves with each persona's goals, tasks, and key questions, as these are what will lay the groundwork for the Diverge phase. 

###### Outputs/Artifacts:

* Visualization Concepts: 
Each team member should organize their ideas on either paper, whiteboard, or Sketch -- whatever works best for sharing and discussion.

## Methods in Diverge Phase

#### Exploratory Research

Before sketching ideas, each individual can search online for visualization examples that answer similar business questions.


#### [Mind Mapping](/3-Diverge/Methods/mind-mapping.md)
A warm up exercise to start generating ideas. People are given time to individually explore the problem however they choose to.


#### [Crazy Eights](../3-Diverge/Methods/crazy-8s.md)
Borrowed from Google Ventures’ book, Sprint, this exercise, each member takes a sheet of printer paper, folds it in half 3 times to get 8 rectangles. They then have 5 minutes to sketch out ideas for a specific feature or flow in a product. After they’re done, they share with the team.
