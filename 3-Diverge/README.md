# Diverge: Illuminating all possible paths

Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how
realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of
opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically
different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights
can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution
inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many of these options as
possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move
forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

* Have a mindset of "Yes" and constantly ask “How might we?”

###### Inputs/Prerequisites:

* Personas and Key Questions: 
The team should familiarize themselves with each persona's goals, tasks, and key questions, as these are what will lay the groundwork for the Diverge phase. 

###### Outputs/Artifacts:

* Rough Sketches of Ideas
Each team member should organize their ideas on either paper, whiteboard, or Sketch -- whatever works best for sharing and discussion.

### Tasks/Activities for Diverge

#### [Mind Mapping](../Exercises/mind-mapping.md)
A warm up exercise to start generating ideas. People are given time to
individually explore the problem however they choose to.

#### [Storyboards](../Exercises/storyboards.md)
This exercise mimics a movie storyboard. You'll be drawing a flow for the user
by using Post-its as frames and writing out out a description next to it. This can help provide a framework for understanding how specific objects and screens can relate to each other when viewing the dashboard as a whole. 

#### [Silent Critique](../Exercises/silent-critique.md)
This critique exercise is a way to get everyones input in a short amount of
time. At the end of the exercise you'll have a heat map of the ideas people find
really interesting.

#### [Group Critique](../Exercises/group-critique.md)

This critique exercise is more open and allows for a more detailed conversation.
It gives the person that came up with the idea to add any remaining details or
correct any wrong interpretations.
