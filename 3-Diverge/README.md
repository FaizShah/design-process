# Diverge: Illuminating all possible paths

Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how
realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of
opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically
different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights
can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution
inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many of these options as
possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move
forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

* Have a mindset of "Yes" and constantly ask “How might we?”

###### Inputs/Prerequisites:

* Personas and Key Questions: 
The team should familiarize themselves with each persona's goals, tasks, and key questions, as these are what will lay the groundwork for the Diverge phase. 

###### Outputs/Artifacts:

* Rough Sketches of Ideas
Each team member should organize their ideas on either paper, whiteboard, or Sketch -- whatever works best for sharing and discussion.

### Tasks/Activities for Diverge


#### Exploratory Research

Before sketching up ideas, each individual can search online for visualization examples that answer similar business questions.


#### [Mind Mapping](/3-Diverge/Exercises/mind-mapping.md)
A warm up exercise to start generating ideas. People are given time to individually explore the problem however they choose to.


#### [Crazy Eights](../3-Diverge/Exercises/crazy-8s.md)
Borrowed from Google Ventures’ book, Sprint, this exercise, each member takes a sheet of printer paper, folds it in half 3 times to get 8 rectangles. They then have 5 minutes to sketch out ideas for a specific feature or flow in a product. After they’re done, they share with the team.
