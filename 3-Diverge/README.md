# Diverge: Illuminating all possible paths

Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how
realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of
opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically
different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights
can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution
inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many of these options as
possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move
forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

* Have a mindset of "Yes" and constantly ask “How might we?”
