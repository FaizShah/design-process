Card sorting is a technique discovering how the users understand, categorize and prioritize information. It could be conducted during the interview with if the team is onsite, or it could be conducted internally after the interview is done. 

### Open / Closed / Hybrid

Card sorting involves creating a set of cards that each represent an item, and asking people to group the cards in a way that makes sense to them. You can run an open, a closed, or a hybrid card sort, depending on what you want to find out.

* Open card sort: Participants sort cards into categories that make sense to them, and label each category themselves
* Closed card sort: Participants sort cards into categories you give them
* Hybrid card sort: Participants sort cards into categories you give them, and can create their own categories as well


### How to get started

To run a card sorting session, the team needs to first define what the cards represent, and then what are the logical categories to use for sorting.

#### What could the cards represent

* Key questions to answer
* Data elements
  * Measure
  * Dimension
  * Measure by Dimension
* Tasks
* Reports
* Etc.

#### What could the categories be

* Needs / Wants / Desires
  
  Start with a feature wish list and condense into columns of priority for "Needs"(aka Must Haves, Top Priority), "Wants"(Nice to Haves), "Desires" (Would love to have someday...). This activity is great for ironing out which features are most important and which could potentially be put on the back burner list.
  
* Available / Possible / Out of Scope

  The team needs to understand the readiness and availability of the back end - What is "Available" (achievable in near future), "Possible" (achievable with extra effort on the back end), and "Out of Scope" (technically unrealistic to pursue). This grouping can also be combined with the Needs/Wants/Desires one, to further iron out the priority.
  
* Timeframe (Daily / Monthly / Quarterly / Annual | Short-term / Long-term)
* Business Functions
* Strategic / Operational
* Analytical / Exploratory
* High Level / Detail
* Etc.
