The Five Whys is a fantastic method to use to get to the core of a person’s beliefs and motivations. The designer can use this method while conducting an interview and start with really broad questions like “Do you save much money?” or “How was your harvest this year?” Then, by asking why five times we can get to some essential answers to complicated problems. 

Steps:
1. This one is pretty easy. Start by asking a pretty broad question about your Interview participant’s habits or behaviors then ask “why” to their response five times in a row. 
2. Remember that you’re not asking a horizontal question, (ie “Why else didn’t you get a good harvest this year?”) you’re actually going for depth (ie “Why weren’t you able to buy the fertilizer you needed?”).
3. Write down what you hear, paying special attention to moments when it feels like you’ve moved a level deeper into understanding why the person does what she does.
4. Keep in mind that you might not get to the core stuff until the fourth or fifth “Why.”
