A critical path is a way of organizing the insights learned from the interviews. Depending on specific circumstances, the path could take different forms to help the team understand the information. It could be a path of key questions that a persona needs to answer, a path of key metrics that shows the their relationship and priority, or a path of data flow between business functions and data sources, ect.
