# Visual Analytics Design Process
This repository is a collection of documents intended to guide the design process at Axis Group. 
It contains guidelines that should not be followed exactly. 
Each design process should be tailored to the individual project or design engagement. 
This document intends to provide a walkthrough of each step in our design process and approaches to create artifacts in each phase.

## What is a design engagement?
A design engagement is a technique to quickly solve design problems and test the viability of a solution.
It allows to better understand the problem at hand, create prototypes and choose a viable solution to the problem at hand.

#### Why do a design engagement?
A design engaement orients the team and aims our efforts towards a mutual goal.
Design thinking and visual analytics design engagements keep us on target and invest our time and money wisely.
Design engagements are useful when kicking off a new business, product, feature, or workflow. 
Design engagements can also be used to solve problems with an existing products, features, or workflows 
and help make them better and efficient.

#### What should you expect to have at the end of a design sprint?
At the end of the design emgagement, the team will understand the problem and will have validated whether 
we have a viable solution to begin building or whether we need to keep searching for a solution. 
Design engagement helps channel efforts towards building a solution that engances usability and 
user experience of interacting with the solution, while achieving the business goal. 

## Design Engagement Overview
The Design process at Axis Group is divided into six phases, 
Understand, Define, Diverge, Decide, Prototype, and Validate. Each phase typically lasts for _________.

#### [Pre-Engagement](0-Pre-Engagement)
Typically, this phase would require performing research on the client and their industry. This phase is non-billable.
The pre-engagement phase should be mainly utilized to formulate a common ground of the ‘job to be done.’ 
The problem could evolve over further discussions, but it should be agreed upon by the entire team. 
This should serve as a starting point for discussions with the client. 

#### [Understand](1-Understand)
The Understand phase develops a common understanding of the context within which we are working and all the elements in that context: 
the customer, their job to be done, and the business our client hopes to support by servicing the job to be done. 
We want to expose risky knowledge gaps and assumptions so we can make plans to reduce those risks and move forward with confidence.

#### [Define](2-Define)
The Define phase focusses on formulating a ‘mission statement’ for the application or problem at hand. 
This problem definition should be agreed upon by all team members, including clients, 
and should serve as a reference point for further discussions. 
The problem statement should encompass a clear scope of the ‘job to be done’ and should serve as a baseline.

#### [Diverge](3-Diverge)
The Diverge phase generates insights and concepts for solutions. 
Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how feasible or viable. 
Insights are born from this explosion of possibilities by considering the implications 
of radically different approaches to solving a problem. 
These insights can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of inspiration for unique solutions.

#### [Converge](4-Converge)
The Converge phase takes all the possibilities generated over the past two phases 
and homes in on a single version to prototype and test with existing or potential customers. 
By exploring and eliminating so many options, we have reason to be more confident in our choices.

#### [Prototype](5-Prototype)
The Prototype phase develops a prototype that fills our riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions. 
______________________________________ are all valid mediums. 
The medium should be determined by our time constraints and learning goals.

#### [Validate](6-Validate)
The Validate phase tests our prototype with existing or potential customers. 
By the end of this phase, we should have validated or invalidated our riskiest knowledge gaps and 
assumptions and have confidence in our next steps.

#### [Design Implementation Support](7-Design-Implementation-Support)
The Design Implementation Support encompasses all efforts towards supporting development 
once the design prototype is approved by the client.
This might entail continued oversight on development and ensuring that the development is as per specifications.
In addition to availability to support and answer any questions or converns faced during development, 
any documentation required to turn over development responsibilities to internal teams shall be created in this phase.
