# Axis Design Process
This repository is a collection of documents intended to guide the design process at Axis Group. 
It contains guidelines that should not be followed exactly. 
Each design process should be tailored to the individual project or design engagement. 
This document intends to provide a walkthrough of each step in our design process and approaches to create artifacts in each phase.
