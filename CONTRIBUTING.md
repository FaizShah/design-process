We love new ideas that push this repository and design sprints forward. We are using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/) 
for tracking our work on the repository. Here are the ways that you can contribute:

## Maintenance and Improvements
If you find a bug, misspelling or other any other problem with the repository, please add a new [issue](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/new).

If you are looking to contribute and are not sure where to start, here is a step-by-step breakdown to help you through: 

1. Grab an issue from the list of [issues/bugs](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/labels/bug) and assign yourself to the issue so that we know someone is working on it. 
2. Make the necessary changes.
3. Submit a [Pull Request](#quick-guide-to-submitting-a-pull-request-in-github).

# New Ideas
Any new ideas or major improvements can be added to a PR so that they can be discussed and tested. 
We especially like new exercises that might add to 
[Understand](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/tree/master/1-Understand), 
[Diverge](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/tree/master/2-Diverge) and 
[Converge](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/tree/master/3-Converge).

# Previous Engagements: Photos, Examples & Case studies
The more examples that we have the better it will be to spread knowledge and experience of running the sprints. 
Listed below are steps for adding examples:

1. Add new project by duplicating the example project folder.
2. Edit the README in that folder and add any other assets that support the explanation of the sprint such as photos, documents, prototypes or videos.
3. Add references on the separate phases to the respective parts of the example.
4. Submit a [Pull Request](#quick-guide-to-submitting-a-pull-request-in-github).
