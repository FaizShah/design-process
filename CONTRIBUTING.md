We love new ideas that push this repository and design sprints forward. We are using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/) 
for tracking our work on the repository. Here are the ways that you can contribute:

## Maintenance and Improvements

#### Submit a new issue

If you find a mistake or have some questions with the repository, please add a new [issue](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/new).

#### Work on an existing issue

1. You can find the list of open issues [here](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues) 
2. Enter your thoughts as comments  
3. Assign yourself to the issue if you want to make some changes so that we know someone is working on it
4. Make changes and submit a Pull Request. [Here's how](#quick-guide-for-pull-requests).

#### Recommend a method

If you want to recommend a method for our design engagement, you can add a new .md file that describes the method under the folder [Methods](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/Methods) in your branch and then submit a pull request. 

The description file should include:
* Definition and purpose of the method
* Which phase it belongs to
* How it works
* Examples
* References or resources

#### Photos, examples & case studies from previous engagements

The more examples that we have the better it will be to spread knowledge and experience of running the sprints. 
Listed below are steps for adding examples:

1. Add new project by duplicating the example project folder.
2. Edit the README in that folder and add any other assets that support the explanation of the sprint such as photos, documents, prototypes or videos.
3. Add references on the separate phases to the respective parts of the example.
4. Submit a [Pull Request](#quick-guide-to-submitting-a-pull-request-in-github).
