After the views are established, the team needs to map the views back to personas to make sure their business goals can be achieved with these views. The mapping can go in two directions: 
* view centered - who is the primary/secondary user of this view, and who doens't use this vew
* persona centered - which views does this persona use to achive what goals and answer what questions
