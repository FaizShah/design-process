Three minute critiques is another group critique exercise. The group gather around the concepts and spend 3 minutes discussing each concept. Instead of explaining the concepts, the group start by making comments on the concepts they like first. Then ask the author if there's anything to add. 

This exercise could be combined with the silent critiques and the group can start with the concept that got most stickers on it.
