Silent critique is an exercise where the group gather around the developed concepts and place stickers on the ones they like or the ones they want to comment on. This process should be silent and explanation can start after everyone is done placing stickers, starting with the one with the most stickers. After all comments are made, the group can rearrange their stickers to only leave them on the concepts they like. As a result, the team can see clearly which concepts are most liked by the internal team, and which ones need more work.
