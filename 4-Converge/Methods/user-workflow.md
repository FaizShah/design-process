A user workflow (aka user flow, or workflow) illustrates how a user walks through the designed solution to achieve his/her business goals. Each persona should have a user workflow. One persona doesn't necessarily need to use every view of the design. This workflow could be combined with the views summary and the personas to views mapping. 

The user workflow chart can include details like:
* frequency of use
* triggers or conditions
* actions or thoughts
* etc.
