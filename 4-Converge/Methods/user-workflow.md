A user workflow (aka user flow, or workflow) illustrates how a user walks through the designed solution to achieve his/her business goals. Each persona should have a user workflow. One persona doesn't necessarily need to use every view of the design. This workflow could be combined with the views summary and the personas to views mapping. 

Example:
