## Silent Critique

#### What is it?
Silent critique is an exercise where the group gather around the developed concepts and place stickers on the ones they like or the ones they want to comment on. It is a silent process.

#### Why do you do it?
There are two benefits in using this method:
* Avoid biased opinions - since this is a silent process and no explanation is given beforehand, everyone reads the concepts on their own so that opinions are not affected by others.
* Sort throught the concepts quickly - at the end of the process, the group can color code the stickers to call out the most liked concepts, or most questioned ones.

#### When to do it?
After concepts are generated, before concept review with client.

#### How to do it?
1. The group gathers around the concepts with stickers in their hands.
2. Everyone reads the concepts silently and put a sticker next to the concepts he/she likes or wants to comment on.
3. After done placing stickers, everyone takes turns explain why he/she put a sticker on the concept.
4. Color code all stickers with categories like "liked" or "questioned".
