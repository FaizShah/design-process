# Converge: Choose the right path

During Converge our goal is to take all of the possibilities
that we have exposed over the past two phases and hone in on a single version of
the prototype that we will build in the next phase.

Throughout Converge, the team should be thinking about the bigger
assumptions that are the most important to test.
This should lead to a discussion
about what [type of
prototype](../4-Prototype#activities-for-prototype) will do the
best job of validating or invalidating it.
Activities such as
[Assumption / Test Table](../Exercises/assumptions.md)
and [Final Storyboard](#final-storyboard)
should help the team engage this conversation.

### Tasks/Activities for Converge

#### [Silent Critique](../4-Converge/Methods/silent-critique.md)
This critique exercise is a way to get everyones input in a short amount of
time. At the end of the exercise you'll have a heat map of the ideas people find
really interesting.

#### [Three Minute Critiques](../4-Converge/Methods/3-minute-critiques.md)

This critique exercise is more open and allows for a more detailed conversation.
It gives the person that came up with the idea to add any remaining details or
correct any wrong interpretations.

#### Group Concepts into Views

After visualization concepts are developed, the team needs to group the concepts into different views. They could be grouped by
* business function
* persona
* time frame
* Type of analysis
* etc.

The groupings could potentially become the different views in the application. The team should discuss and weigh out the pros and cons of each group of views. Then decide which views the app should have, and what the workflow should be. 

#### [Map Personas to Views](../4-Converge/Methods/personas-to-views.md)

After views are decided, the team needs to map personas to the views. The mapping will provide paper trail for the design decisions in the  process. 

#### Concept Review with Client

Reviewing visualization concepts with the client allows the team to validate the usefulness, usability, and desiredness of their ideas. It is also a check point for the team to confirm whether we're on the right track or not in general. 

The concepts don't need to be high fidelity for this review, but they should be presentable and organized in a meaningful way. Potential views and the mapping between personas and views can also be reviewed by the client for validation purpose. 

#### Back Burner Board

As a group review all the Back burner ideas. Document the ones that are still
applicable and throw away any that aren't.
