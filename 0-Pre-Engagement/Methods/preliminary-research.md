#### 1. Annual Report / 10K Report / 10Q Report
For public companies, these financial reports are available online. Annual report or 10K report provides a high level view of past year's operation, business strategies, major business issues and certified financial details. A 10Q report provides similar information for the past quarter.

#### 2. Business Model Canvas Questionnaire
The [Business Model Canvas](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/10/canvas1.gif) is a useful tool to understand a business as a whole. By filling out questions around the company's key activities, value propositions, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue stream, the team will gain a comprehensive understanding of how the business is run, and what in particular is important.

#### 3. Key Metrics & Processes Definitions
To establish a baseline of understanding and start interviews with a common language, it'll be important for team members to research basic processes and metrics common to the industry and/or business domain.

[Morningstar](www.morningstar.com) provides helpful definitions of key metrics and ratios.
[Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/) also provides detailed descriptions on financial processes and calculations.
