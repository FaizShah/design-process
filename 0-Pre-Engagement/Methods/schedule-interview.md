# Schedule Interviews

The team should send out requests to schedule interviews with the client and block
time on their calendars to gather further understanding of the problem. This shall ensure
that the client is available to answer questions, provide insight, and provide any additional
information that might be required by designers to further their understanding. The team should also identify key reports or screenshots that would be useful to obtain prior to interviewing users. 

It's ideal to schedule interviews and request materials soon after the pre-kickoff meeting, since logistical details and interview requirements will be top of mind for the Project Sponsor.

## Email Template for Scheduling Interviews

Hi [Name],


//*Summary of pre-kickoff meeting and logistics. If team members are arriving at different times, include a list or attach a document detailing members' arrival and departure schedules. If interviews must take place virtually, include a time frame that the team is available, and give the client flexibility to schedule within that time frame.*//


We’re looking forward to kicking off the project on [date], and being on site from [start date] to [end date]! As previously discussed, we will need to schedule interviews with [list of users/roles]. I’ll leave it up to you to decide the easiest method of communicating the schedule with us, whether it’s via Outlook calendar invites, a spreadsheet, or email, but I’ve included below some helpful details about the required interviews: 


|Date|Time Needed|Users|Purpose|
|------|------|------|------|
|7/12/17| 1 hour prior to 1PM if possible| Melissa, Justin, 4 end users identified by Melissa/Justin, Paul(optional)| Walk through invision app with [Designer Name].  Understand how it works and how to lead feedback.  Communicate expectations.  Review scope.|
|7/12/17, 7/13/17 | 12 hours – users should block out time on schedule to validate | Melissa, Justin, 4 end users | Work online testing invision app – explore concepts, views, filters, drill-down, UI/UX in general and leave comments on refinements or additional functionality needed.  Feedback will go directly to Gen and he will work on incorporating changes that are understood and in scope while users are testing. |


//*Specifics about what interviewees can expect. Be sure to ask for any reports or screenshots as well.*//


Interviewees can expect to be asked about what their roles are, what tasks they perform in [name of application / existing solution], how they do it, and why they do it. We may also ask to observe them use [name of existing solution] in the context of a typical use case. 

Thanks for all your help!
