# Capturing Research

The team should capture the research performed on the company, industry, business function, and client history. This will provide a paper trail for future design deicisions, and can easily be passed on to other team members to bring them up to speed.

## Methods to Capture Research

#### 1. Interview Checklist 
The interview checklist includes any assumptions, key ideas, and questions that were formed during the Pre-Engagement phase. This checklist will evolve with the project, with items being added and resolved as the engagement progresses. It will also serve useful as a paper trail for future design decisions.
The team should use this checklist to help guide interviews and keep track of what is learned.

A spreadsheet is useful for capturing this information in a table format, like so:

| 				| 				| Who to Ask/Confirm With | Follow Up Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------			  | ------------- 	|
| Assumption 	| Assumption 1  | 			  |  	|						
|  				| Assumption 2  | 			  |  	|
| Key Ideas		| Idea 1	    | 			  |  	|
|  				| Idea 2	    |			  |  	|
| Key Questions	| Question 1    |			  |  	|
|  				| Question 2    |			  |  	|

#### 2. Business Model Canvas Questionnaire
The [Business Model Canvas](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/10/canvas1.gif) is a useful tool to understand a business as a whole. By filling out questions around the company's key activities, value propositions, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue stream, the team will gain a comprehensive understanding of how the business is run, and what in particular is important.

#### 3. Key Metrics & Processes Definitions
To establish a baseline of understanding and start interviews with a common language, it'll be important for team members to research basic processes and metrics common to the industry and/or business domain.

[Morningstar](www.morningstar.com) provides helpful definitions of key metrics and ratios.
[Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/) also provides detailed descriptions on financial processes and calculations.
