# Pre-Engagement: Prepare for the engagement

The Pre-Engagement phase is typically non-billable. This phase typically serves as 
the team's readiness to dive into the engagement. In this phase, the team should 
develop a strong understanding of the industry that the client is in, as well as the client's
business. The goal should also be to develop a strong understanding of the Scope of Work (SOW)
and know the limitations therein.

Annual Reports, 10K Reports, and Key Metrics should serve as sources for 
performing industry research and know the client. In addition, the team should also 
make an effort to talk to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) at Axis Group 
for the specific client and industry.

At the end of Pre-Engagement phase, the team should established a solid understanding of 
the client, the industry they are in, and the scope of the engagement. The team should 
now be well-set to dive into the next phase of engaging with the client and understanding 
the problem at hand.

## A Guide for Pre-Engagement
As you work through the Pre-Engagement phase of an engagement, there will be a lot of
information that is gathered about the industry as well as the client. It is important to 
embrace all information that you could gather. 'The more information, the better' attitude will come
handy during this phase.


###### Inputs/Prerequisites:

* Statement of Work (SOW): 
This is a formal scope of work approved by Axis Group and the client. This document
encompasses the scope of the design engagement and helps narrow the team;s focus 
on the end goal.


###### Outputs/Artifacts:

* Capture Industry and Client Research:
The team should document research outcomes as they would be useful in furture phases to 
ensure that the team has common grounds for formulating assumptions and identifying risks.
Capturing research shall also serve as a repository for any similar sprints in future.

* Requests to Schedule Interviews/ Request for Information:
The team should identify resources and key stakeholders from the client-side and 
send out requests to schedule interviews, and request for additional material/information. 
This ensures that the client is prepared with information that the design team might require
to better understand the problem at hand.

## Tasks/Activities in the Pre-Engagement phase:

#### [Pre-Kickoff Meeting](../Exercises/card-sorting.md)
The design team should collaborate with the Solutions Director (SD) to discuss and 
thoroughly understand the Statement of Work (SOW). This shall ensure a common grounds of
understanding the 'job to be done.'

#### [Schedule Interviews](../Exercises/schedule-interview.md)
The team should send out requests to schedule interviews with the client and block
time on their calendars to gather further understanding of the problem. This shall ensure
that the client is available to answer questions, provide insight, and provide any additional
information that might be required by designers to further their understanding.
