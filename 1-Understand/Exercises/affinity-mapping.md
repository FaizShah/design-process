Affinity mapping, also know as affinity diagram, is a great way to gather information from the users and then categorize them into meaningful groups. Here's a brief description of the process:

* A designer will play the role of the facilitator and write down questions on a big whiteboard, like 
  * What's the first thing you look at on a typical Monday morning?
  * What is your primary success criteria?
  * What do you worry about on a daily/monthly/quarterly basis?
  * Etc.

* The users write down their answers on sticky notes, and put them on the whiteboard. 
* The group talk through their answers.
* Rearrange the sticky notes to explore meaningful themes.
* Name themes and finish affinity diagram.

This exercise isn't limited to the Understand phase, but also can be applied in the Diverge phase. The team can use this approach to collect and group visual concepts.
