The interview checklist includes any assumptions, key ideas, and questions that were formed during the Pre-Engagement phase. This checklist will evolve with the project, with items being added and resolved as the engagement progresses. It will also serve useful as a paper trail for future design decisions.
The team should use this checklist to help guide interviews and keep track of what is learned.

A spreadsheet is useful for capturing this information in a table format, like so:

| 				| 				| Who to Ask/Confirm With | Follow Up Notes | Date | Open/Closed |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------			  | ------------- 	| ------------- 	| ------------- 	|
| Assumption 	| Assumption 1  | 			  |  	|  	|  	|		
|  				| Assumption 2  | 			  |  	|  	|  	|
| Key Questions	| Question 1    |			  |  	|  	|  	|
|  				| Question 2    |			  |  	|  	|  	|
| Key Ideas		| Idea 1	    | 			  |  	|  	|  	|
|  				| Idea 2	    |			  |  	|  	|  	|
