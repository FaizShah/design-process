When a user demonstrates the process of using a report or an app, the designer needs to understand the user's thought process, observe the chain of actions, and identify any gaps or pain points. 

* What is the first thing you look at?
* What does it measure? 
* What is the comparison that tells you whether it is good or bad?
* What is the next thing you look at if it is good/bad?
* Repeat till the next step is outside of this report/app.
